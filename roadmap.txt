Welcome!  This is my Embedded Systems Development Kit (ESDK) project roadmap!

===== What is this? =====
> ESDK is my attempt at making a general and highly flexible PCB learner's kit for 
  embedded microcontrollers.
> Simplicity and maximum flexibility is the goal with what is probably a massively
  over-engineered PCB for what is needed xD

===== Goals =====
> Cost <= 100 USD
> Tiered challenges:
    - Base
        1 - I2C Intro - Communicate with LEDs via an I2C controller
        2 - Interrupts - Process real-time events effectively
    - Middle
        1 - DIY Serial - Software bit-banging serial data to a shift register
    - Upper
        1 - DIY I2C - Custom hardware driver

===== Revision History =====
